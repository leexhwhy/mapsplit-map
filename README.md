mapsplit-map
============

\- work in progress \-

A simple, do-it-yourself solution of generating your own vector tiles and using them in the Browser with Leaflet - 
no database and no special vector tile server needed.

Very alpha and inefficient right now, so it's slow and might also crash your Browser.

*[Demo](http://norbertrenner.de/osm/mapsplit-map/)*<br>
(best viewed with Chrome/Chromium, Firefox should also work)
